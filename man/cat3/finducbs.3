NAME
       finducbs - scan on-line DASD UCBs, invoking a user-supplied subroutine
       for each matching volume serial.

SYNOPSIS
       finducbs (int *subroutine, u_int *userword, int *argc, int **argvl int
       **argv)
       The first parameter passed is the address of a subroutine or NULL.


          The subroutine.
              int subroutine(struct ucb *, struc dce *, struc cmtx *, u_int
              *userword) The first parameter passed to finducbs, if not NULL
              i.e. 8 bytes of x'00', is the address of an LE enabled
              subroutine.  The finducbs routine passes a parameter list
              containing exactly four fullword entries to it.  The first
              fullword is the 31-bit address of the UCB which matched one or
              more of the patterns. The second is the address of the DCE for
              that device. The third is the address of the UCB extention for
              that UCB.  The fourth is the value of the second fullword passed
              to finducbs.  If the return code from the subroutine is not
              zero, then finducbs stop processing with a return code of 2 and
              the LE MODIFIER field set to the subroutine's return code.
