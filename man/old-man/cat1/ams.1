NAME
       ams - Invoke batch IDCAMS, redirecting input from stdin and output to stdout.

SYNOPSIS
          ams


DESCRIPTION
       The ams command attaches the IDCAMS program with a parameter list which invokes an input routine to get its input and an output routine to print its output.

       The input routine reads stdin (file descriptor 0). It sends individual lines delimited by an NEL character (0x15) as separate input records (with the NEL
       removed), to be processed by IDCAMS.

       The output routine receives the output which normally goes to SYSPRINT. This routine adds an NEL (0x15) to the end of the line and writes it to stdout (file
       descriptor 1).

FILES
       ams
        does not use any input or output files.

EXAMPLES
   Local z/OS Examples
       ams
          Reads from the user's terminal and write to it.

       ams <input.file
          Uses redirection of stdin to read its commands from input.file.  Output goes to the user's terminal.

       ams <input.file >output.file
          Uses redirection of stdin to read its commands from input.file and redirection of stdout to write its output to output.file.

       cat input.file1 input.file2 | ams
          Uses redirection of stdin from a pipe to read its commands from the catenation of files input.file1 and input.file2.
