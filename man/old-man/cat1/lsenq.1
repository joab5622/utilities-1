       lsenq - list ENQ information

SYNOPSIS
       lsenq [-t [field-separator]] [-d] [qname] rname

DESCRIPTION
       lists the ENQ information for all the enqueues which match the specified QNAME and RNAME on the command line.


OPTIONS
       -t [field-separator]

          use the given character(s) as the field separator. Defaults to a tab.

       -d

          output debugging information to stderr.

       -o

          encode non-printable bytes with octal escapes.

       -h

          encode non-printable bytes with hexadecimal escapes.

EXIT STATUS
        =0 The command has completed successfully.
        !=0 The return code from the ISGQUERY request.
        In this case, a message will be written to stderr containing the return and reason code from ISGQUERY.

NOTES
       If there is only one argument:

       ·  It is assumed to be the RNAME.

       ·  The QNAME is assumed to be SYSDSN.

       ·  The value is converted to upper case since data set names are usually in upper case.

EXAMPLES

       lsenq isp.sisppenu


   list ENQs on a data set name which contains lower case characters
       lsenq SYSDSN DSN.WITH.lower.case.IN.IT
