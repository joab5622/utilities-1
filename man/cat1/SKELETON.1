NAME
       template - one line description

SYNOPSIS
          template [OPTION...] dataset-name
          template -sock [OPTION...] dataset-name
          template -ssh [ssh-opt...] user@host [OPTION...] dataset-name
          template -local dataset-name
          template -v
          template -h


DESCRIPTION
       The template command reads a z/OS MVS dataset and writes a stream of
       data to stdout. Lines (if requested) are produced from dataset records
       based on the options provided.

       The template command runs in one of three environments:

       o  locally (default on z/OS sytems)

       o  remotely, from a client-initiated ssh connection: -ssh option

       o  remotely, from a client which was started by Co:Z launcher: -sock
          (default option on non-z/OS systems)

       The user has wide flexibility in choosing:

       o  How dataset-name is to be allocated/opened for writing

       o  How records are to be created from the incoming source lines

       o  What character set (codepage) translations are to be performed

       dataset-name is automatically converted to upper case, and is assumed
       to be fully qualified unless otherwise specified (see the -r option
       below). If dataset-name starts with 'DD:', then it refers to an
       existing DDNAME.

       The template command also supports reading JES spool files using
       special dataset-name syntax:

       o  -JES.jobid - reads the concatenated spool files for a given job.

       o  -JES.jobid.dsid - reads a specific spool file by numerid dsid.

       o  -JES.jobid.[stepname[.procstep]ddame - reads the first spool file in
          a job that matches a step/procstep/ddname.


OPTIONS
       -sock
          Specifies a remote invocation of template from a client environment
          running under a Co:Z Agent. This is the default for non-z/OS
          environments. If specified, this must be the first command option.

       -ssh [ssh-options...] user@host
          Specifies a remote invocation of template using a client-initiated
          ssh connection to the given z/OS user@host. If specified, this must
          be the first command option.

       -local
          Specifies the use of local z/OS I/O, even if run via CoZLauncher. If
          specified, this must be the first command option.

       -b binary mode, same as -l none -p 0x00.

       -h display help and exit.

       -k keep trailing pad characters in record. The default is to trim if
          dataset-name has fixed length records.

       -K always trim trailing pad characters, even if the dataset contains
          variable-length records.

       -l line-separator
          nl | cr | lf | crlf | crnl

          follow lines with a newline, carriage return, linefeed, or
          combination. The characters are taken from the target codepage. The
          default is nl.

          ibmrdw

          preceed lines with a four byte IBM-style RDW, consisting of a two
          byte network order (big endian) length, followed by two bytes of
          zeros.

          mfrdw

          Write a 128 byte MicroFocus standard header prior to output data.
          Preceed each line with a network order (big endian) length. If the
          maximum record length is < 4095 bytes, the length field is 2 bytes.
          If the maximum record length is >= 4095 bytes, the length field is 4
          bytes. Each line is padded with zeros to the nearest 4 byte
          boundary.

          rdw

          preceed lines with a four byte network order (big endian) length.

          0xbb[bb..]

          follow lines with a hex character sequence. The sequence must be
          between 1 and 8 bytes long.

          none

          no line separator

       -L logging-options
          A comma-separated list of options to control logging and tracing:

          M | A | C | E | W | N | I | D | T

          Logging threshhold: eMergency, Alert, Critical, Error, Warning,
          Notice, Info (default), Debug, Trace.

          t

          Prefix log messages with a system timestamp

          e

          Include consumed cpu time in log messages

          s

          Messages are logged to SYSLOG facility instead of stderr

          logname=M|A|C|E|W|N|I|D|T

          Set a specific log name to the given threshold

       -o fopen-options
          additional mode arguments to the z/OS C library fopen() routine. The
          base mode options used by template to open dataset-name are
          rb,type=record,noseek". See "z/OS C++ Programming Guide" for
          details.

       -p 0xbb
          pad character.

       -r 0xbb
          dataset-name will be prefixed with the current z/OS userid.

       -s source-codepage
          The codepage name or numeric CCSID id of the input dataset. If not
          specified, then the default z/OS process codepage is used.

       -t target-codepage
          The codepage name or numeric CCSID id of data written to stdout. If
          not specified and invoked from a remote client with a line-
          separater other than 'none', 'ibmrdw', 'mfrdw' or 'rdw', then the
          default client codepage is used, otherwise the default z/OS code-
          page is used. Translation is disabled if source-codepage equals
          target-codepage.

       -v display the current version and exit.

       -x bpxwdyn-alloc-keywords
          can be specified to provide more precise control over the
          disposition of dataset-name than the fopen-options. For example,
          opening a dataset with fopen forces a disposition of 'OLD'. This may
          not always be desirable in a shared batch environment. The bpxwdyn
          keywords enable different dispostions to be specified (e.g 'SHR').
          If dataset-name is 'DD:name', then this option is ignored. For a
          complete list of options, see the IBM manual: "Using REXX and z/OS
          UNIX System Services".

FILES
       template may obtain name matched profile information for a dataset from
       either a per-user profile or a system-wide profile on the z/OS system.
       For well known dataset-name patterns, profile options can be used to
       significantly reduce the specification of individual options on the
       command line. The file format and profile options are described in
       dsn_profile(5).

EXAMPLES
   Local z/OS Examples
