NAME
       unixlog - log messages

SYNOPSIS
       logger string ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  logger  utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner and for-
       mat, containing the string operands provided by the user. The  messages
       are  expected  to  be  evaluated  later  by personnel performing system
       administration tasks.

       It is implementation-defined whether messages written in locales  other
       than the POSIX locale are effective.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       string One  of  the  string  arguments  whose contents are concatenated
              together, in the order specified, separated by single <space>s.


STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of  log-
       ger:

       LANG   Provide  a  default value for the internationalization variables
              that are unset or null. (See  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of
              IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section  8.2,  Internationalization Vari-
              ables for the precedence of internationalization variables  used
              to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all
              the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of  sequences  of
              bytes  of  text  data as characters (for example, single-byte as
              opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format
              and  contents  of diagnostic messages written to standard error.
              (This means diagnostics from logger to the user or  application,
              not  diagnostic  messages that the user is sending to the system
              administrator.)

       NLSPATH
              Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of
              LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       Not used.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       Unspecified.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       This  utility  allows  logging of information for later use by a system
       administrator or programmer in determining why  non-interactive  utili-
       ties  have  failed.  The locations of the saved messages, their format,
       and retention period are all unspecified.  There is  no  method  for  a
       conforming application to read messages, once written.

EXAMPLES
       A batch application, running non-interactively, tries to read a config-
       uration file and fails; it may attempt to notify the system administra-
       tor with:


              logger myname: unable to read file foo. [timestamp]

RATIONALE
       The  standard developers believed strongly that some method of alerting
       administrators to errors was necessary. The obvious example is a  batch
       utility, running non-interactively, that is unable to read its configu-
       ration files or that is unable to create or  write  its  results  file.
       However,  the  standard developers did not wish to define the format or
       delivery mechanisms as they have historically been (and  will  probably
       continue  to be) very system-specific, as well as involving functional-
       ity clearly outside the scope of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

       The text with LC_MESSAGES about diagnostic messages  means  diagnostics
       from  logger  to  the user or application, not diagnostic messages that
       the user is sending to the system administrator.

       Multiple string arguments are allowed, similar to  echo,  for  ease-of-
       use.

       Like  the  utilities  mailx  and  lp, logger is admittedly difficult to
       test. This was not deemed sufficient  justification  to  exclude  these
       utilities from this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. It is also arguable
       that they are, in fact, testable, but that the tests themselves are not
       portable.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
