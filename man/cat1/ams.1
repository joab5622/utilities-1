NAME
       ams - Invoke batch IDCAMS, redirecting input from stdin and output to
       stdout.

SYNOPSIS
          ams


DESCRIPTION
       The ams command attaches the IDCAMS program with a parameter list which
       invokes an input routine to get its input and an output routine to
       print its output.

       The input routine reads stdin (file descriptor 0). It sends individual
       lines delimited by an NEL character (0x15) as separate input records
       (with the NEL removed), to be processed by IDCAMS.

       The output routine receives the output which normally goes to SYSPRINT.
       This routine adds an NEL (0x15) to the end of the line and writes it to
       stdout (file descriptor 1).

FILES
       ams
        does not use any input or output files.

EXAMPLES
   Local z/OS Examples
       ams
          Reads from the user's terminal and write to it.

       ams <input.file
          Uses redirection of stdin to read its commands from input.file.
          Output goes to the user's terminal.

       ams <input.file >output.file
          Uses redirection of stdin to read its commands from input.file and
          redirection of stdout to write its output to output.file.

       cat input.file1 input.file2 | ams
          Uses redirection of stdin from a pipe to read its commands from the
          catenation of files input.file1 and input.file2.
